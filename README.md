# Safe and Secure Art Contest

The SSAC community is my personal project using all the knowledge and skills I got from the [Alchemy University](https://university.alchemy.com/) Ethereum Dev. Bootcamp.

SSAC is a community that enables artists and art enthusiasts to enter Art Contests (With their NFT's). Winners get rewarded ETH and SSAC token. The winner's NFT gets auctioned in the Community where members can purchase the NFT. The amount the NFT get sold for is shared among the voters. So users get rewarded for their good choice of ART.
